### Here are all the project files from Mech 105(Mechanical Engineering Problem Solving)

1.  **Special Matrix**

This program will create a special matrix with two input numbers. I manipulated various cells of a two dimensional array while filtering through the entire array to access previous array values. For example, if my function was called with the inputs as *n = 5*, and *m = 4*, the following matrix would be outputted:
```
     1     2     3     4
     2     4     7    11
     3     7    14    25
     4    11    25    50
     5    16    41    91
```

from the example you can see that my function created an array with 5 rows and 4 columns. The first element starts at one. For the rest of the array, the element is defined by adding the element above it with the element to the left of it. 
 
 2. **ND** 

This file calculates the number of days when inputted a number of months and days. The program is able to account for leapyears. If the number of days is calculated for a leapyear, the program will add 1 day to the final answer to account for the leapyear. The user must input if it is a leapyear or not.

For example, if my function was called with the inputs as *mo = 2*, *da = 1*, *leap = 0*<br> the result would be outputted as 60 days.

3. **Homework 7 question 1** 

This code shows left division which is used in matrix algebra. The basic formula follows: A\B;

4. **Homework 15**

This code shows LU decomposition.

5. **Homework 6_5**

This code is a binary converter created in Matlab. 

6. **Homework 23**

This code solves for derivatives of inequally spaced data points. The user inputs three consecutive, but unequally spaced data points.
The user then decides which data point to solve the derivative at. The code outputs the derivative at the given point. 

7. **Matrix diagonal Addition**

This file demonstrates diagonal Addition, a practice taught in matrix algebra.
